"""
Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle:
Declare two variables, length and width, and assign values to them.
Calculate the area using the formula: area = length * width.
Print a message displaying the dimensions and the area using concatenation or formatting.
"""

length = 15
width = 10
area = length * width
print ("The area of a the rectangle with a length of" , length , "and a width of" , width , "is" , area)
#I could've simply used print to state at least the length and width, but it was more fun this way.
#I couldn't add a period at the end unfortunately, at least not without using a string concentration, but we haven't learned about those in the modules yet.
#I know about the string concentrations already because I already finished the entire 2nd module on the Python Institute before starting this assignment.
